Cool things to add:
- export the entire key for monoalphabetic, playfair, etc

Playfair
- digraph analysis specifically for playfair, so it won't count the ones that arent paired together
- determine if playfair if 
  a) frequency test doesn't work for trans or mono
  b) no j's
  c) even number of letters
